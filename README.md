# Lagspike!
A Geode mod for Geometry Dash that displays real-time physics stability metrics.

## What It Does
Shows an on-screen overlay with:
- **Physics Stability Graph** - Visual display of frame timing consistency
- **Jitter Value** - Measures variance in physics frames (lower = smoother)
- **Stability %** - Percentage of frames within target timing
- **Engine Status** - Green (stable) or Red (jittering)

## Technical Details
- Tracks all 240 physics frames per second
- Calculates jitter using standard deviation
- Microsecond-precision timing
